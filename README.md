# AWS-Educate-IAM-Lab
Hands-on AWS Educate IAM Simulation — Created IAM policies, users, and groups; tested EC2 &amp; S3 access controls, and validated role-based permissions through task-based simulations.

# AWS Educate — IAM Simulation Lab

This project documents my completion of the AWS Educate **Introduction to IAM Simulation**.
The lab focused on Identity & Access Management, role-based permissions, and secure access
controls for EC2 and S3 environments.

## Objectives Completed

- Created a **custom IAM policy** for limited EC2 admin access  
- Created IAM **user groups** (EC2-Admin, EC2-Support, S3-Support)
- Created IAM **users** and assigned them to groups
- Tested **role-based permissions** through login simulations
- Validated EC2 stop/start permissions vs read-only access
- Added users to groups dynamically and reviewed inherited policies
- Tested S3 read-only restrictions and blocked upload actions
- Demonstrated **least-privilege security design**
